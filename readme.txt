This project adds Agricraft support for a handful of new mods.

A few things to note:
- If the soil grants a bonus of any kind (such as faster growth or higher yield), it may not affect the Crop Sticks or what is planted on them. However, bonuses like not requiring water, or being unable to be trampled, should work just fine.
- None of the added plants have mutations, as that would be an enormous project and out of scope for me. However, I will accept PRs on GitHub if you'd like to add your own.
- You do not need to have all the mods listed in order to use these jsons. If a particular mod is not present, content from that mod will simply be ignored.

Here is a list of all the mods that have had their soils and plants added:
- Cuisine
- Farming for Blockheads
- Growthcraft
- Some additional HarvestCraft items
- Mystical World
- Roots
- Rustic
- Silent's Gear
- Silent's Gems
- XL Food Mod
